Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that's still perfectly edible! The secret is in honey's unique chemistry - it's incredibly acidic and has almost no water, making it impossible for bacteria to survive. Ancient Egyptians even used honey to preserve their dead. So that jar in your pantry? It could literally last forever!
